# Graphs
 
 We would like to start with the case study of Tunisia, which is a focal point of our project. 
 This is the map of a "Flawed" Democracy, as per widely accepted definitions and our analysis. The map was generated on CorText and consists of four key clusters: 
 
> Green: president and interference/
> Orange: ideology and trade/
> Blue: individual and free/
> Teal: religion and parliament/

# IMPACT AND SUPPORT 

The research can help policy makers, lawyers, academics, civil servants and international organisations who are trying to analyse and understand constitutions better. It can also help constitutional reforms especially in conflict ridden societies and newly formulated nation states. International law and agenda setting should also take into account these key considerations. Constitutional making processes and their substantive outcomes are a reflection of the political interests of the rulers at any given time

Constitutional reforms can often end long standing conflicts and issues. Although we recognise that there is no “best practice” or an “ideal constitution”, our research is a good stepping stone into the study of constitutional structure, language and composition. We recognise that a document as important as a this would need to be contextualised which can only be done if numerous constitutions are critical reviewed and understood. The larger goal of our project, while recognising that co—relation is not causation however, to bring about systemic long term change there is a need to alter formal and informal institutions of the society that are conducive to progress and equality.

One of the key functions of a constitution must be to adapt to the needs of the political community that it orders. We wish to understand common structural elements and juxtapose them with regional disparities/conditions to make them area specific and suitable. Our goal is to ensure that constitutions are framed in a way that ensures that certain human rights are upheld and tackle socio-political and economic challenges for the welfare of all.



We’ve highlighted a few countries that are in desperate need of constitutional reform and believe they can benefit best by collaborating with us. These include Siera Leone, Spain (with regard to Catalonia), Yemen, Syria, India(Kashmir issue) etc.

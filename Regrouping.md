# Regrouping Experiment 

Regrouping Experiment:
As an experiment we tried to regroup all the constitutions of the world to create a map that group countries together on the basis if the similarities in their constitutions. This can not only be a good tool to analyse the historical impact of countries on each other but to also understand power dynamics and hegemonies. 

-Methodology: 
A network map was created using Cortext to analyse the interaction between different constitutions.  Cortext creates nodes and clusters based on the co-occurrence and proximity of words in the data. We created a heterogeneous map using “filename” as the first field and “terms” as the second one to calculate “200” nodes. “Cosine_het” was used as the proximity measure, with a 0.8 proximity threshold and only short range edges were considered. 

Results: 
This regrouping has some obvious but also some interesting insights. As it is very evident, the role of former colonies has especially been felt on states e.g. the French colonies (in yellow) and new states formed after the breakdown of the soviet union (blue) highlight this fact. A layman would believe that simple because the nations are in geographical proximity, they may have a large impact on each other and have similar cultures and societies, however, as in the case of Africa, the map shows so many colours and hence how different players have influenced each other. It would also be interesting to look at Staes like china, cuba who are/were socialist states and their close proximity reiterate the fact that constitutions aren’t just simple texts but living documents that may reflect on historical/contemporary reality

Human Development Index and Constitutions 
	The United Nations Development Program (http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI) keeps track of the human development index. HDI is used to ascertain the quality of life in a country Although not perfect, it is a scientific and reasonably accurate measure of the quality of life.  In an attempt to review the relationship between HDI and constitutions, we analysed the text and study the findings.

Methodology: 
  After running a terms extraction and filtering words, a terms list was created to analyse the relationship between constitutions and HDI. The constitutions were divided into 4 subgroups based on their HDI rankings in order to assess the interplay of the terms within these 4 HDI categories and parsed. Network maps were created using ‘terms’ as the field and edges modified to include only  "short range" cooccurrences.

Contingency matrix:
Is a matrix used to highlight (multivariate) frequency distribution of the variables in the dataset. This  matrix was created using HDI rankings on the y axis and terms found in constitutions in the x axis. A contingency matrix was created by listing the HDI ranks with their respective countries and a ‘terms list’ which consisted words like ‘power’, ‘development’ etc. 



The findings can be enthralling and some key results have been highlighted:

-   Terms like power correlates to high HDI 
-	Terms like “Development” occurs frequently in low HDI
-	Terms like “health care” are also found more often in countries with low HDI
	Of course, these claims are debatable but our interpretation is that countries ranking low on the HDI scale may have a cyclic problem, which they have recognised and to compensate also added in their constitutions.

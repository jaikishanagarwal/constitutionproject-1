# About the Project 

### Mission Statement 
> Using digital tools, The Constitutions Project aims to understand formal government guidelines better and their impact on different social, political and economic performance of various countries. Juxtaposing language, texts, social norms, political culture and economics, our objective is to understand the interplay of these factors. We wish to use our research outcomes to promote best practices or models that promote just, equitable societies, and enrich our intellectual environment.

### History 
> Started in 2017, by three students at Sciences Po, The Constitutions Project who  believed constitutions despite being considered “fundamental laws” and living documents, apart from periods when amendments are proposed, are not given much attention after their conception.  Being one of the first of it’s kind, they aimed to analyse constitutions and how instrumental they are in reflecting socio-political realities.

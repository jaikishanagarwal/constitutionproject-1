# Constitutions


We would like to thank [the Constitute Project](https://www.constituteproject.org/) for their painstaking work on collecting and translating the constitutions of the world into English. The Constitute Project is an open-source initiative for anyone and everyone to compare and contrast the varying constitutions around the world. They have been a vital cog for our project.     
- Please find all avaiable constitutions we have used for our project at this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ril37dvz4wqvdx/Constitutions.zip?dl=0)  

We would also like to thank Professor Jean Philipe Cointet for being an important part of our journey

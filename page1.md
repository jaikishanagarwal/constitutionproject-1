# Constitutions


We would like to thank [the Constitute Project](https://www.constituteproject.org/) for their work on collecting all the constitutions of the world as an open-source initiative for any and all projects to compare and contrast them. They have been a vital cog for our project.     
- Please find all avaiable constitutions we have used for our project at this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ril37dvz4wqvdx/Constitutions.zip?dl=0)
